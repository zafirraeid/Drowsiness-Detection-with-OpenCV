#Wake Up

Ever wanted to stay up and pull an all nighter for an exam you have in the morning?
Well, Wake Up is here to help you! Using OpenCV and WinSound, I developed this program
which detects your eyes movements using the 68 facial landmark points and Haar Cascades.
If the eyes reamian shut beyond a certain period of time, a sound will played to awake the user.
